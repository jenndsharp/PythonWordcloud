# PythonWordcloud
Creating Python shaped word cloud to display survey results. In this example, it will be displaying information from a fake accessibility survey in the shape of the international sign of accessibility (a person in a wheelchair). Note a great deal of this work was created by following the information provided by Datacamp creator Duong Vu (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/wordcloud-python), but further simplified as I work through it and add information for a complete beginner so they only need to follow the steps given.
