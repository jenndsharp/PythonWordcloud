# Begin by downloading:
  anaconda prompt (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual, look for the download button)
  spyder (https://www.spyder-ide.org/, scroll down and look for the download button) - used as work area after packages are installed
  pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/) - performs data analysis

#open anaconda prompt and type the lines that do not begin with #

#install anaconda navigator
conda install -c anaconda anaconda-navigator

#install numpy - handles multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
conda install numpy

#install matplotlab - enables other libraries (such as wordcloud) for visualizations
conda install matplotlib

#install pillow - enables image reading
conda install -c anaconda pillow

#install wordcloud - places your word cloud in a chosen shape
conda install -c anaconda git
git clone https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git
cd word_cloud

#import installed packages through python within anaconda prompt

#create data file - save your data file as data.csv or use the name of the file in place of "data.csv"

#open Spyder app - further code is entered in Dpyder

# Load in the dataframe
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", index_col=0)

# Looking at first 5 rows of the dataset
df.head()

#show sample of data
print("There are {} observations and {} features in this dataset. \n".format(df.shape[0],df.shape[1]))
